                                            I grew up in a small town in the mountains of southern California. I spend my summers hiking and camping every weekend, and during the winter I snowboard at least once a week. I love to be outdoors and experience new adventures. Most of my free time is spent time either playing or watching sports. Some people even say I have an unnatural love for BYU Football. In recent years I have spent a lot of time traveling. I have been to 10 different countries and love learning about and experiencing new cultures. I had a life-changing opportunity to spend a summer in Madagascar. Ever since I have longed to go back and create a better system than currently exists. I want to use my love for sports to teach children in underdeveloped countries the same skills I learned growing up playing sports. I learned responsibility, respect, and teamwork. I learned how to fail successfully and improve through those failures. Those lessons have shaped me into who I am. I want these children to grow up one day and make lasting changes in their own life and countries.

                            I want to change the world by creating sports programs for children in underdeveloped countries. Sports have the power to teach people lessons that simply cannot be learned in any other way. The purpose of the program would be to provide lifelong, impactful lessons that can be taught through the lens of sports. Ideally, I would build a program that is sustainable and train local people to maintain and continue to build. My end goal is not to let children play sports, but to allow them to gain the strengths that I developed because of my personal participation in sports. I learned responsibility. I learned how to be a good team member. I learned how to fail successfully and improve through those failures. Those lessons have shaped me into who I am and led me to be a successful, collaborative and respectful person living in society. I want children to learn these lessons so they too can one day grow up and make lasting changes in their own life and beyond. I want them to become the ethical business and political leaders that can then perpetuate value and goodness within that country. As trite as it may sound, I truly want to make the world a better, more enjoyable place.

                            Since elementary school I have been drawn to underdeveloped countries. My dad lived in Africa for a while and would send pictures of the people and place and I felt connected to a group of people I had never met. Years later I had the chance to spend a month traveling and experiencing life in Madagascar. I was able to see the way these people lived. It was an indescribable, life-changing opportunity. Ever since I have longed to go back and create a better system than currently exists. A couple years later I had the opportunity to go on a study abroad trip to India. This trip gave me hope that my dream of instigating change is actually reachable. I had the opportunity to work closely with a small start-up trying to provide jobs to single moms. I was not only able to help instigate a difference in these women's lives but also gain valuable experience and insights.
